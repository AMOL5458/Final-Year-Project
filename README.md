# Final-Year-Project
My Final year project is "Air Water Pollution Sensing Smart Watch". In this project you to check the exact value of air pollution ,water pollution, gas, turbudity, PH of water, whiich is in your surroundings.
Air and water pollution causes of global warming. The first step toward pollution is to able to measure it. people need to know about pollution level so we built a smart watch to monitor pollution level anywhere & any time desired.
It is an IOT based project where we can use various sensors to measure the exact value.
for Air we use MQ135, for gas we use MQ6, turburity Sensor, PH sensor also we can set the default value for Air and gas where the value is growing more than 30 it gives warning about bad pollution .also we set 500 for PH value and for turbudity we set 6-7. when It goes below the value and upper the value it gives warning on display.
